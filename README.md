## Health Tracker Desktop Application

This is a desktop application that was developed using JavaFX. It was created as part of my software engineering module at UEA where I worked with 2 other students. 

Users can input their height, weight and age and are given a recommended daily calorie intake to lose, maintain or gain weight. Exercises are also suggested based on the userâ€™s inputted target weight and finish date. Users can add and save custom food items and exercises.

To run this application:

1. Clone the repository
2. Open the project in your favourite IDE (we used IntelliJ) and run Launch.java in the applications folder.
